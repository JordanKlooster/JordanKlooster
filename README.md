- 👋 Hi, I’m @JordanKlooster
- 👀 I’m interested in Math, and Game Dev in Godot.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about complex number math, writing, foraging and plant identification.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
1. A custom calendar system that might intergrate with google or other calendars? 
2. A program like a combination of desmos and a vector art program. 
3. A good fork of Audacity and Musescore unless the company stops being dumb, idk I don't follow it too closely.
4. A free open source version of the Transcribe! Software or ScoreCloud. Software for transcribing music.
5. And something like the visual analyzer from http://www.sillanumsoft.org/  not sure if there's an ociloscope thing in that.
6. An app like Daylio that can be customized and changed (w/ options in the app, or maybe even scripting in some places) however anyone wants. Or simones calendar.
7. Something to do with how electricity works, possibly doing educational stuff with that.
- 📫 How to reach me ...go on twitter? @jp_klooster
